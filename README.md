# Limit Switch Cloud/EX Mode Cloud
Skyline plugin that modifies Cloud's effects while in Limit Break form as well as swapping his weapon in Limit Break. Also replaces his weapon during Final Smash. Inspired by Cloud's EX Mode in Dissidia Final Fantasy.

## General Changes
* Sword trails are changed to the blue variant during Limit Break for the following moves:
  * Neutral Aerial
  * Up Aerial
  * Back Aerial
  * Forward Tilt
  * Up Tilt
  * Up Smash
* The default swordflare effect are removed for most moves to provide consistency with the weapon visually (applies to all normal moves and Limit Break Special Moves)
* Blue variant of effects for the following moves (this is due to these moves utilizing a unique effect from other moves and so a duplicate was made courtesy of effect converter):
  * Forward Aerial
